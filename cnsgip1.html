                <img src="C:\Users\veeks\cns\upma.jpeg" alt="i1"><br><br>To prepare Upma, begin by roasting 1 cup of semolina (rava) in a pan over medium heat until it turns light golden and emits a pleasant aroma. Set the roasted semolina aside. In the same pan, heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil and add 1 teaspoon each of mustard seeds, urad dal, and chana dal, along with 8-10 halved cashew nuts. Fry until the dals and cashews are golden brown. Add 2 finely chopped green chilies, 1 inch of finely chopped ginger, and 10-12 curry leaves, sautéing briefly. Incorporate 1 finely chopped medium onion and cook until translucent. Optionally, add 1 small finely chopped carrot and 2 tablespoons of green peas, sautéing until tender. Pour in 2 ½ cups of water, season with salt to taste, and optionally, 1 teaspoon of sugar. Bring the mixture to a rolling boil. <br> Gradually add the roasted semolina to the boiling water while stirring continuously to avoid lumps. Cook on medium heat until the semolina absorbs the water and the mixture thickens. Cover and let it cook on low flame for 2-3 minutes. Finally, turn off the heat, mix in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and garnish with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped coriander leaves. Serve the Upma hot, optionally with coconut chutney or sambar. Enjoy your delicious Upma!

                <br>To prepare a simple and delicious omelette, start by cracking 2 eggs into a bowl and seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. Beat the eggs until well combined and slightly frothy. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of butter or oil, ensuring it coats the pan evenly. Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and let them cook undisturbed until the edges start to set. Optionally, add fillings like grated cheese, diced vegetables, or cooked ham. Gently fold the omelette in half when the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny on top. Cook for another minute until fully set and any cheese is melted. Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot. Enjoy this quick and versatile dish for breakfast or a light meal! <br>

Add the remaining rice and repeat the layering process. Cover and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes until the rice and chicken are fully cooked. Garnish with fried onions, chopped coriander leaves, and boiled eggs. Serve hot with raita and enjoy this flavorful Chicken Biryani! <br>

                <br>To prepare Gulab Jamun, mix 1 cup of milk powder with 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour and a pinch of baking soda in a bowl. Gradually add 2-3 tablespoons of milk to form a soft dough. Shape the dough into smooth balls, ensuring they are crack-free. Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium heat and fry the balls until they turn golden brown. In a separate pan, combine 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of water and bring to a boil to make the sugar syrup. Add a few drops of rose water or cardamom powder for flavor. Simmer for 5 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove the fried Gulab Jamun from the oil and immediately soak them in the warm sugar syrup for at least 1 hour. Serve Gulab Jamun warm or chilled, garnished with chopped pistachios or almonds. Enjoy these soft and sweet treats! <br>
